Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
 Northeast - 

Discharge Diagnosis:
brainstem hemorrhage involving R midbrain, bilateral pons, and
4th ventricle, likely hypertensive etiology.

Discharge Condition:
The patient was hemodynamically stable and afebrile.  His
neurolgic exam was notable for the following:
Responds to voice and follows simple commands.  Pupils equal but
right eye with minimal reaction.  Able to move eyes in the
vertical plane with down-gaze better than upgaze; occasional
lateral eye movement; minimal adduction of the eyes.
Can move right fingers, wrist and occasionally his arm, right
toes. Myoclonic movements of the mouth and right shoulder.
Occasional movement of the fingers of the left hand an toes.
Reflexes are brisk throughout.  Appropriate responses to noxious
stimuli in all extremities.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after being found unresponsive.  You have
suffered a major hemorrhage in your brain which has resulted in
your inability to move, eat or speak.  You are being discharged
to a long term care facility for continued treatment and
therapy.

Followup Instructions:
None

Example: 'You had bleeding in your brain. You're getting better but need help moving. You'll go to a special hospital to continue recovering.'
